# Above are the combined surface numbers for secondary, glass plate and absorber
# The fourth value is '2*ly3D' = 50.0 [m], the total length of the receiver.
# Secondary mirror surfaces: total = 24, combined = 1
#                     Ratio: total/combined = 24.0
# Bottom glass plate surfaces = 1
# Absorber tube surfaces: total = 24, combined = 1
#                  Ratio: total/combined = 48.0
